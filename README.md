# Identity and Access Management with Microsoft Entra
## Overview
This project documents the design and implementation of Identity Governance and Access Management for a small to mid-sized B2C SaaS organization providing personal analytics to end users. Starting from business context and risk, the project defines roles, identity populations, and governance rules before implementing IAM controls using Microsoft Entra. The focus is on establishing repeatable, mature identity processes such as joiner-mover-leaver lifecycle management, role-based access, privileged access governance, and access reviews. The outcome demonstrates how identity governance decisions are operationalized in Entra to support growth, protect user trust, and reduce identity-related risk.

Every deliverable is centred on a fictional business scenario that involves sensitive data and various roles.
