# 1: Organizational and Governance Objects

## 1.1 Organizational Context and Business Scenario
- **1.1.1 Document company profile, business model, and growth stage**
- **1.1.2 Identify sensitive data types and business-security considerations**

**Company Profile:** **Insightra** is an 80-person B2C SaaS company provides software products specializing in personal analytics to end users. The platform aggregates user provided data and behavioral signals to generate individualized insights and recommendations. The company has recently found product market fit and is scaling engineering, customer support, and partnerships quickly, along with IT to facilitate new technology infrastructure to support expanded business functions.
#### Sensitive Data
- User provided personal data, including behavioral and preference data
- Derived analytics and insight profiles generated by the platform
- Internal model logic, feature engineering, and ranking algorithms
- Limited employee PII and operational data
#### Business-security considerations
The business is currently scaling its internal structure and operations to meet new demand. Lax trust and low governance might have worked to keep things fluid for the startup, but this is no longer a case for the company. Identity management needs to be formalized, balancing productivity (ie. employees can access the data and technology needed to perform their tasks) without compromising security.
  - Allow data science teams to iterate quickly without unrestricted access to raw user data
  - Ensure customer support can assist users without viewing unnecessary personal details
  - Prevent overprivileged access as teams grow and responsibilities shift

While the scope of IAM changes are internally focused, user trust must be preserved as a core business asset as _some_ sensitive personal data passes through Insightra's production environment to help develop and improve products. Misuse or exposure of data would directly impact user trust and brand credibility.

Workload and API-replated identity risk must be accounted for 

## 1.2 Identity Populations and Role Definitions 
### 1.2.1 Identify human identity populations (employees, contractors, partners)
- Full time employees across engineering, data science, product, customer support, marketing, and operations
- Contractors supporting data labeling, model tuning, customer support overflow, and cloud operations
- External partners integrating through API
### 1.2.2 Identify non-human identity populations (apps, services, APIs)
- Application and service identities powering data ingestion, analytics pipelines, and notification systems
### 1.2.3 Define business roles and ownership

## 1.3 Risk-Based Access Tier Model
Different identity populations are exposed to sensitive data or workloads, making them predispositioned to some risk. I am taking a risk-based approach to identity and access management, which means strategically amping up the IAM effort in specific areas that demand more monitoring and control.
### 1.3.1 Define access risk tiers
Tiers are like buckets of risk that classify the degrees of _impact_.
These buckets have different levels of capacity, filled by the severity of impact, which I will measure along the following dimensions:
- **Data sensitivity:** Impact derived from the exposure, alteration, or misuse of data.
- **Ability to modify systems:** Impact derived from being able to change system configuration, code, identity controls, or infrastructure in ways that affect (or even compromise) system behaviour, security posture, or availability.
- **Trust/reputational impact:** Impact derived from the erosion of user, customer, or partner trust resulting from perceived misuse, mishandling, or loss of control over data or systems.
- **Blast radius:** Impact derived from the scope and scale of consequences.

| Tier | Data sensitivity | Ability to modify systems | Trust / reputational impact | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 – Privileged Access** | Exposure or alteration of large volumes of highly sensitive data, including data across multiple systems and domains. | Full ability to modify core infrastructure, system configuration, identity controls, and security mechanisms, fundamentally changing system behavior and availability. | Severe erosion of user and partner trust, including failure of due care and due diligence expectations, with long-term brand damage. | Organization-wide impact affecting multiple systems, services, and users, requiring full incident response and recovery. |
| **2 – Sensitive Data Access** | Access to personal data and derived analytical outputs where misuse directly affects confidentiality and privacy. | Limited system modification capability, with access focused on data rather than control planes. | High trust impact due to personal nature of data, potentially affecting user confidence and privacy expectations. | Scoped but meaningful impact, typically affecting defined user populations or datasets rather than the entire platform. |
| **3 – System Influence** | Little to no direct access to sensitive personal data, but access may indirectly affect data handling. | Ability to modify code, configurations, or non-production environments that influence system behavior and may propagate into production. | Moderate trust impact if misuse leads to instability, vulnerabilities, or downstream production issues. | Typically limited to internal systems or environments, but with potential for cascading effects if issues are not detected. |
| **4 – Automation and Non-human Execution** | Data exposure depends on permission scope; misuse may involve bulk data movement or processing. | Permissions enable automated interaction with systems and data, amplifying impact due to lack of human judgment. | Trust impact escalates quickly if automation misuse affects users at scale or causes service disruption. | Potentially large blast radius due to rapid, repeated, and scalable execution across systems or datasets. |
| **5 – General Access** | Access limited to non-sensitive internal information with minimal confidentiality concerns. | No ability to modify systems, configurations, or controls. | Minimal reputational impact if misused, with little to no effect on user trust. | Negligible impact, typically isolated to individual users or internal tooling. |

### 1.3.2 Map roles to risk tiers
### 1.3.3 Define governance expectations per risk tier

## 1.4 IAM and IGA Policy

### 1.4.1 Define identity lifecycle governance
This will establish the Joiner-Mover-Leaver cycle for various identities, from creation to deprovision. The cyclical nature of access management ensures that identities only exist and are provisioned wihtin necessity.

1. When an identity begins existing;
2. What access is necessary/appropriate;
3. What conditions/events change access;
4. When and how access ends.
5. 

### 1.4.2 Define RBAC principles and ownership
### 1.4.3 Define access review requirements
### 1.4.4 Define privileged access governance

## Identity Governance Policies

(My approach the policy development is to first remember why we govern identity management - it's so that, whatever we implement in Entra, it facilitates + protects the needs of the business and supports + secures people, processes, and information. Get this out of the way, then walk through how to bridge - I just made sure that the documented policies that enable IAM will exhibit the qualities of a satisfactory business system - timely, accurate, adaptable, fixed, diligent, thorough, etc. Pick and choose)

| Policy | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Joiner-Mover-Leaver / Lifecycle | Defines when access is granted, what baseline access is assigned, what changes when moving roles, and when access is removed |
| Role-based Access (RBAC) | Defines what business roles exist, what access each roles include, who owns the role, and how often roles are reviewed |
| Access Request and Approval | Defines who can request access, who can approve/grant access, and when acccess expires |
| Segregation of Duties | Defines constraints for access combinations, and how to handle exceptions |
| Exceptions and Temporary Access | Defines when exceptions are allowed, who approves it, and when access should expire |
| Access Reviews | Defines what access must be reviewed, who reviews it, how often access should be reviewed, and how excess is remediated |
| Privileged Access Governance | Defines and reasons who may hold admin privileges, for how long, and frequency of review |
