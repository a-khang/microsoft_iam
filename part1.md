# 1: Organizational and Governance Objects

## 1.1 Organizational Context and Business Scenario
### 1.1.1 Document company profile, business model, and growth stage
**Company Profile:** An 80-person B2C SaaS company provides a personal analytics product to end users. The platform aggregates user provided data and behavioral signals to generate individualized insights and recommendations. The company has recently found product market fit and is scaling engineering, customer support, and partnerships quickly.
### 1.1.2 Identify sensitive data types and business-security considerations
#### Sensitive Data
- User provided personal data, including behavioral and preference data
- Derived analytics and insight profiles generated by the platform
- Internal model logic, feature engineering, and ranking algorithms
- Limited employee PII and operational data
#### Business-security considerations
- Preserve user trust as the core business asset. Misuse or exposure of data would directly impact user trust and brand credibility.
- Lax trust and informal access are no longer viable for the company, now scaling their user base and operations. Security must be strengthened, but it cannot impede productivity. Repeatable identity governance must be established.
  - Allow data science teams to iterate quickly without unrestricted access to raw user data
  - Ensure customer support can assist users without viewing unnecessary personal details
  - Prevent overprivileged access as teams grow and responsibilities shift
- Govern service and API identities as first class risk objects

## 1.2 Identity Populations and Role Definitions 
### 1.2.1 Identify human identity populations (employees, contractors, partners)
- Full time employees across engineering, data science, product, customer support, marketing, and operations
- Contractors supporting data labeling, model tuning, customer support overflow, and cloud operations
- External partners integrating through API
### 1.2.2 Identify non-human identity populations (apps, services, APIs)
- Application and service identities powering data ingestion, analytics pipelines, and notification systems
### 1.2.3 Define business roles and ownership

## 1.3 Risk-Based Access Tier Model
### 1.3.1 Define access risk tiers
### 1.3.2 Map roles to risk tiers
### 1.3.3 Define governance expectations per risk tier

## 1.4 IAM and IGA Policy

### 1.4.1 Define identity lifecycle governance
This will establish the Joiner-Mover-Leaver cycle for various identities, from creation to deprovision. The cyclical nature of access management ensures that identities only exist and are provisioned wihtin necessity.

For each identity type (1.2), I will 
1. When an identity begins existing;
2. What access is necessary/appropriate;
3. What conditions/events change access;
4. When and how access ends.

### 1.4.2 Define RBAC principles and ownership
### 1.4.3 Define access review requirements
### 1.4.4 Define privileged access governance

## Identity Governance Policies

(My approach the policy development is to first remember why we govern identity management - it's so that, whatever we implement in Entra, it facilitates + protects the needs of the business and supports + secures people, processes, and information. Get this out of the way, then walk through how to bridge - I just made sure that the documented policies that enable IAM will exhibit the qualities of a satisfactory business system - timely, accurate, adaptable, fixed, diligent, thorough, etc. Pick and choose)

| Policy | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Joiner-Mover-Leaver / Lifecycle | Defines when access is granted, what baseline access is assigned, what changes when moving roles, and when access is removed |
| Role-based Access (RBAC) | Defines what business roles exist, what access each roles include, who owns the role, and how often roles are reviewed |
| Access Request and Approval | Defines who can request access, who can approve/grant access, and when acccess expires |
| Segregation of Duties | Defines constraints for access combinations, and how to handle exceptions |
| Exceptions and Temporary Access | Defines when exceptions are allowed, who approves it, and when access should expire |
| Access Reviews | Defines what access must be reviewed, who reviews it, how often access should be reviewed, and how excess is remediated |
| Privileged Access Governance | Defines and reasons who may hold admin privileges, for how long, and frequency of review |
