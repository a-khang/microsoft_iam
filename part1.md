# Part 1: Identity Governance and Business Context
_The rising frontier of insider threats and privilege escalation-based attacks are amplified by the lack of effective identity lifecycle management and authentication/authorization measures. At the same time, employees, collaboators, and workloads (APIs, apps, services) must be able to access the right resources at the right time to do their jobs._

_(There needs to be some way to introduce identity governance. Abstract out into IT governance and the role it has in bridging the chasm between technical competence and business needs.)_

## IAM Scenario: Company Profile
**An 80-person B2C SaaS company** provides a personal analytics product to end users. The platform aggregates user provided data and behavioral signals to generate individualized insights and recommendations. The company has recently found product market fit and is scaling engineering, customer support, and partnerships quickly.
### Identity Population
- Full time employees across engineering, data science, product, customer support, marketing, and operations
- Contractors supporting data labeling, model tuning, customer support overflow, and cloud operations
- External partners integrating through API
- Application and service identities powering data ingestion, analytics pipelines, and notification systems
### Sensitive Data
- User provided personal data, including behavioral and preference data
- Derived analytics and insight profiles generated by the platform
- Internal model logic, feature engineering, and ranking algorithms
- Limited employee PII and operational data
### Business Priorities
- Preserve user trust as the core business asset. Misuse or exposure of data would directly impact user trust and brand credibility.
- Lax trust and informal access are no longer viable for the company, now scaling their user base and operations. Security must be strengthened, but it cannot impede productivity. Repeatable identity governance must be established.
  - Allow data science teams to iterate quickly without unrestricted access to raw user data
  - Ensure customer support can assist users without viewing unnecessary personal details
  - Prevent overprivileged access as teams grow and responsibilities shift
- Govern service and API identities as first class risk objects

## Identity Governance Policies

(My approach the policy development is to first remember why we govern identity management - it's so that, whatever we implement in Entra, it facilitates + protects the needs of the business and supports + secures people, processes, and information. Get this out of the way, then walk through how to bridge - I just made sure that the documented policies that enable IAM will exhibit the qualities of a satisfactory business system - timely, accurate, adaptable, fixed, diligent, thorough, etc. Pick and choose)

| Policy | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Joiner-Mover-Leaver / Lifecycle | Defines when access is granted, what baseline access is assigned, what changes when moving roles, and when access is removed |
| Role-based Access (RBAC) | Defines what business roles exist, what access each roles include, who owns the role, and how often roles are reviewed |
| Access Request and Approval | Defines who can request access, who can approve/grant access, and when acccess expires |
| Segregation of Duties | Defines constraints for access combinations, and how to handle exceptions |
| Exceptions and Temporary Access | Defines when exceptions are allowed, who approves it, and when access should expire |
| Access Reviews | Defines what access must be reviewed, who reviews it, how often access should be reviewed, and how excess is remediated |
| Privileged Access Governance | Defines and reasons who may hold admin privileges, for how long, and frequency of review |

## Appendix: The Importance of IGA
I have chosen to start this Identity and Access Management project with Identity Governance and Administration. To me, it makes sense to figure out a strategy and accountability framework for security within your organization before you can do the work of IAM. I think employers are primarily concerned with whether or not I can implement an identity/access-related decision with tools like Entra. I value pragmatism but for my own learning I wanted to expand my focus on where IAM fits into the larger picture of the business. 

To paint this picture, consider that:
Strategy identifies a course of actions to reach the organization’s objectives, positioning the organization for long-term well-being. In security contexts, these strategies also take into account high-level risks.
Governance involves decision-making and policy-setting to establish a system of rules, processes, and structures to manage an organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, and efficacy. The structures of governance define who makes decisions.
Management concerns how to tactically make and implement decisions.

We can go off these high-level descriptions for the sake of simplicity in putting things together.

### Security Strategy
The objective of any security strategy would be to protect its crown jewels (sensitive data in this case) and achieve a level of high maturity in its cybersecurity practices. The need for maturity is driven by these key factors:
Awareness of identity-related risks
Influx of personal data through growing user and employee bases increase the risk impact, due to rapidly scaling business
Lack of formal or repeatable identity and access management processes

Based on NIST CSF’s maturity model, we see that the company's cybersecurity maturity is **Tier 2: Risk-informed:** The company is aware of cybersecurity risks at a high level but they lack an organization-wide approach to managing those risks. With these findings, a reasonable target for the company’s current, overall cybersecurity strategy would be to achieve **Tier 3 Maturity.**

_At the Repeatable level, an organization has standardized its cybersecurity governance and risk management processes and practices and implemented them across the enterprise. These processes are consistent and repeatable, meaning they can be reliably reproduced and executed. The organization regularly reviews and updates cybersecurity practices based on the changes in business/mission requirements, threats, and technological landscape._

The goals set out in the strategy are handed off to different security functions, which includes Identity and Access Managmement. To achieve repeatable processes, access decisions should no longer be informal or person-dependent, but role-based, reviewable, and consistently enforced across users, applications, and environments. This will flow nicely into Identity Governance where we set out policies. (See the table above, where these policies are outlined.)

### Identity Governance
Identity Governance produces the rules, ownership, and constraints that IAM tools must enforce. Without these inputs, IAM becomes a collection of disconnected technical controls rather than a risk management system.
