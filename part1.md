# 1: Organizational and Governance Objects

## 1.1 Organizational Context and Business Scenario
- **1.1.1 Document company profile, business model, and growth stage**
- **1.1.2 Identify sensitive data types and business-security considerations**

**Company Profile:** **Insightra** is an 80-person B2C SaaS company provides software products specializing in personal analytics to end users. The platform aggregates user provided data and behavioral signals to generate individualized insights and recommendations. The company has recently found product market fit and is scaling engineering, customer support, and partnerships quickly, along with IT to facilitate new technology infrastructure to support expanded business functions.
#### Sensitive Data
- User provided personal data, including behavioral and preference data
- Derived analytics and insight profiles generated by the platform
- Internal model logic, feature engineering, and ranking algorithms
- Limited employee PII and operational data
#### Business-security considerations
The business is currently scaling its internal structure and operations to meet new demand. Lax trust and low governance might have worked to keep things fluid for the startup, but this is no longer a case for the company. Identity management needs to be formalized, balancing productivity (ie. employees can access the data and technology needed to perform their tasks) without compromising security.
  - Allow data science teams to iterate quickly without unrestricted access to raw user data
  - Ensure customer support can assist users without viewing unnecessary personal details
  - Prevent overprivileged access as teams grow and responsibilities shift

While the scope of IAM changes are internally focused, user trust must be preserved as a core business asset as _some_ sensitive personal data passes through Insightra's production environment to help develop and improve products. Misuse or exposure of data would directly impact user trust and brand credibility.

Workload and API-replated identity risk must be accounted for 

## 1.2 Identity Populations and Role Definitions 
### 1.2.1 Identify human identity populations (employees, contractors, partners)
- Full time employees across engineering, data science, product, customer support, marketing, and operations
- Contractors supporting data labeling, model tuning, customer support overflow, and cloud operations
- External partners integrating through API
### 1.2.2 Identify non-human identity populations (apps, services, APIs)
- Application and service identities powering data ingestion, analytics pipelines, and notification systems
### 1.2.3 Define business roles and ownership

## 1.3 Risk-Based Access Tier Model
Different identity populations are exposed to sensitive data or workloads, making them predispositioned to some risk. I am taking a risk-based approach to identity and access management, which means strategically amping up the IAM effort in specific areas that demand more monitoring and control. The model can be used as an aid to standardize and justify access decisions.
### 1.3.1 Define access risk tiers

| Tier | Risk impact summary | Governance decision it drives |
|---|---|---|
| **5 – Privileged Access** | Access at this tier enables modification of core infrastructure, identity systems, and security controls, fundamentally altering system behavior, availability, and integrity. Misuse may expose or compromise large volumes of highly sensitive data across multiple systems, creating organization-wide impact. The resulting trust and reputational damage would be severe, including failure of due care and due diligence expectations, and would likely require full incident response and recovery. **Normally requires privileged or control-plane access to perform the role.**| Access must be exceptional, time-bound, and tightly controlled. Standing access is avoided where possible. Requires senior approval, just-in-time elevation, strong authentication, continuous logging, and frequent access reviews. |
| **4 – Sensitive Data Access** | Access at this tier involves personal data or derived analytical outputs where misuse directly affects confidentiality and privacy. While system modification capabilities are limited, the personal nature of the data creates high trust impact for affected users. The blast radius is typically scoped to defined user populations or datasets but carries meaningful legal, ethical, and reputational consequences. **Interaction with sensitive personal or employee data is expected for the role.**| Access must follow least-privilege principles and be tied to a clear business purpose. Requires documented justification, manager or data-owner approval, and regular access reviews to ensure ongoing necessity. |
| **3 – System Influence** | Access at this tier allows modification of code, configurations, or environments that influence system behavior without direct access to sensitive production data. Misuse presents latent risk, as changes may introduce vulnerabilities, instability, or downstream production issues. Trust impact is indirect but material if issues propagate, with a blast radius typically limited to internal systems but capable of cascading. | Access requires environment separation, change accountability, and periodic review. Production-impacting actions should be constrained and monitored, with controls to prevent unintended propagation into sensitive environments. |
| **2 – Automation and Non-human Execution** | Access at this tier is held by applications, services, or integrations that perform automated processing or data movement. While data exposure depends on permission scope, misuse can occur rapidly and at scale due to automation and lack of human judgment. Trust impact escalates quickly if automation affects users broadly or disrupts services, with a potentially large blast radius. **These roles only require visibility.**| Access must be narrowly scoped, explicitly owned, and regularly reviewed. Permissions should be minimized, credentials protected and rotated, and automated activity monitored to detect misuse or unintended behavior. |
| **1 – General Access** | Access at this tier is limited to non-sensitive internal information with no ability to modify systems or controls. Misuse carries minimal confidentiality, operational, or reputational impact, and effects are typically isolated to individual users or internal tooling. | Access can follow lightweight approval and infrequent review, with basic authentication controls. Governance focuses on maintaining baseline hygiene rather than intensive oversight. |

### 1.3.3 Define governance expectations per risk tier

## 1.4 IAM and IGA Policy

### 1.4.1 Define identity lifecycle governance
This will establish the Joiner-Mover-Leaver cycle for various identities, from creation to deprovision. The cyclical nature of access management ensures that identities only exist and are provisioned wihtin necessity.

1. When an identity begins existing;
2. What access is necessary/appropriate;
3. What conditions/events change access;
4. When and how access ends.
5. 

### 1.4.2 Define RBAC principles and ownership
### 1.4.3 Define access review requirements
### 1.4.4 Define privileged access governance

## Identity Governance Policies

(My approach the policy development is to first remember why we govern identity management - it's so that, whatever we implement in Entra, it facilitates + protects the needs of the business and supports + secures people, processes, and information. Get this out of the way, then walk through how to bridge - I just made sure that the documented policies that enable IAM will exhibit the qualities of a satisfactory business system - timely, accurate, adaptable, fixed, diligent, thorough, etc. Pick and choose)

| Policy | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Joiner-Mover-Leaver / Lifecycle | Defines when access is granted, what baseline access is assigned, what changes when moving roles, and when access is removed |
| Role-based Access (RBAC) | Defines what business roles exist, what access each roles include, who owns the role, and how often roles are reviewed |
| Access Request and Approval | Defines who can request access, who can approve/grant access, and when acccess expires |
| Segregation of Duties | Defines constraints for access combinations, and how to handle exceptions |
| Exceptions and Temporary Access | Defines when exceptions are allowed, who approves it, and when access should expire |
| Access Reviews | Defines what access must be reviewed, who reviews it, how often access should be reviewed, and how excess is remediated |
| Privileged Access Governance | Defines and reasons who may hold admin privileges, for how long, and frequency of review |
