_The rising frontier of insider threats and privilege escalation-based attacks are amplified by the lack of effective identity lifecycle management and authentication/authorization measures. At the same time, employees, collaboators, and workloads (APIs, apps, services) must be able to access the right resources at the right time to do their jobs._
